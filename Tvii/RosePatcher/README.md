## Help

### My console is crashing at the Wii U Menu! I also have a Japan console!
Well we were not able to detect your console automatically, so on your sd card, go to <b>sd card</b> > <b>wiiu</b> > <b>environments</b> > <b>aroma</b> > <b>plugins</b> > <b>config</b>, and then open the the file named <b>rosepatcher.json</b>. After you have opened the file, change the <i>force_jpn_console</i> value from <b>false</b> to <b>true</b>
